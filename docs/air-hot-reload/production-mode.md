# Production Mode

## Overview

Production mode uses pre-compiled Go binaries instead of Air hot reload. This provides better performance, smaller images, and optimized deployments.

## Key Differences: Development vs Production

| Aspect | Development | Production |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Build Process** | Live compilation with Air | Pre-compiled binaries |
| **Image Size** | Larger (includes Go toolchain) | Smaller (Alpine + binary) |
| **Startup Time** | Slower (compilation on start) | Fast (direct binary execution) |
| **Resource Usage** | Higher (file watching, compilation) | Lower (static binary) |
| **Environment** | `APP_ENV=development` | `APP_ENV=production` |
| **File Watching** | Enabled | Disabled |
| **Source Mounting** | Required | Not needed |

## Production Commands

### Start Production Environment

```bash
# Start all services in production mode
make up

# Or with explicit environment
APP_ENV=production make up
```

### Build Production Images

```bash
# Build optimized production images
make docker-build
```

## Production Docker Configuration

### docker-compose.yml (Production)

```yaml
services:
  api-gateway:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: api-gateway/Dockerfile
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=production
      - LOGGING_LEVEL=info
      - LOGGING_FORMAT=json
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    restart: unless-stopped

  user-service:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: services/user-service/Dockerfile
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_HOST=postgres
      - LOGGING_LEVEL=info
      - LOGGING_FORMAT=json
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8081/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Production Dockerfile Structure

### Multi-Stage Build Process

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependencies
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build optimized binary
RUN cd api-gateway && CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o api-gateway ./cmd

# Final stage
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the binary from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/api-gateway/api-gateway .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

# Run the binary
CMD ["./api-gateway"]
```

### Build Optimizations

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CGO_ENABLED=0` | Disable CGO for static linking |
| `GOOS=linux` | Target Linux OS |
| `-a` | Force rebuild of packages |
| `-installsuffix cgo` | Separate CGO and non-CGO caches |
| `-o api-gateway` | Output binary name |

## Environment Variables

### Production Environment

```bash
# Application
APP_ENV=production
LOGGING_LEVEL=info
LOGGING_FORMAT=json
DOCKER_ENV=true

# Database
DATABASE_HOST=postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_NAME=service_db
DATABASE_SSL_MODE=disable

# Service Ports
API_GATEWAY_PORT=8080
USER_SERVICE_PORT=8081
DATABASE_PORT=5432
```

### Environment Control

The `APP_ENV` variable controls the mode:

- **`APP_ENV=development`**: Enables Air hot reload
- **`APP_ENV=production`**: Runs pre-compiled binaries

## Deployment Workflow

### 1. Build Production Images

```bash
# Build optimized images
make docker-build

# Or manually
docker-compose build
```

### 2. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Start production environment
make up

# Verify services
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

### 3. Monitor Services

```bash
# View logs
make logs

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats
```

## Performance Benefits

### Image Size Reduction

- **Development**: ~1.2GB (includes Go toolchain + Air)
- **Production**: ~15MB (Alpine + static binary)
- **Reduction**: ~92% smaller images

### Startup Time

- **Development**: 10-30 seconds (Go compilation)
- **Production**: 1-2 seconds (direct binary execution)
- **Improvement**: 15-30x faster startup

### Resource Usage

- **Development**: Higher CPU during rebuilds, file watching
- **Production**: Consistent low resource usage
- **Memory**: ~50% reduction in production

### Build Time

- **Development**: Incremental builds (fast after first)
- **Production**: One-time optimized build
- **Distribution**: Pre-built images for faster deployments

## Security Considerations

### Production Hardening

- **Static Binaries**: No runtime dependencies
- **Non-root User**: Run as unprivileged user
- **Minimal Base Image**: Alpine Linux for security
- **Health Checks**: Automatic service monitoring
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints

### Environment Isolation

```yaml
# Production docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - APP_ENV=production
  - LOGGING_LEVEL=info
  - LOGGING_FORMAT=json
```

## Switching Between Modes

### Development to Production

```bash
# Stop development environment
make down

# Switch to production
APP_ENV=production make up
```

### Production to Development

```bash
# Stop production environment
make down

# Switch to development
make dev
```

### Environment File

Create `.env` file for easy switching:

```bash
# Development
APP_ENV=development
LOGGING_LEVEL=debug

# Production
# APP_ENV=production
# LOGGING_LEVEL=info
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

Production services include comprehensive health checks:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 10s
```

### Log Management

```bash
# View structured JSON logs
make logs

# Filter by service
docker-compose logs -f api-gateway

# Export logs for analysis
docker-compose logs > production.log
```

### Resource Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats

# Check disk usage
docker system df

# Clean up unused resources
docker system prune -f
```

## Troubleshooting Production

### Common Issues

#### Slow Startup
```bash
# Check health status
docker-compose ps

# View startup logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50 api-gateway
```

#### Health Check Failures
```bash
# Test health endpoint manually
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs api-gateway
```

#### Resource Issues
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Check container limits
docker-compose config
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Binary Optimization
```dockerfile
# Use build flags for smaller binaries
RUN go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o app ./cmd
```

#### Multi-Stage Builds
```dockerfile
# Separate build and runtime stages
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS builder
# ... build stage

FROM scratch AS runtime
# ... minimal runtime
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Build Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Build production images
  run: make docker-build

- name: Deploy to production
  run: |
    APP_ENV=production docker-compose up -d
```

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Test production build
make docker-build
make up
# Run integration tests
make test-integration
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Multi-Stage Builds** for smaller images
2. **Enable Health Checks** for service monitoring
3. **Configure Resource Limits** to prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Use Structured Logging** (JSON format) for production
5. **Implement Graceful Shutdown** for zero-downtime deployments
6. **Monitor Performance Metrics** for optimization
7. **Regular Security Updates** for base images
8. **Backup Strategies** for persistent data

## Using Air in Production

While production mode typically uses pre-compiled binaries for optimal performance, Air is included in production Docker images to provide flexibility for specific operational scenarios. This allows operations teams to leverage hot reloading capabilities when needed without rebuilding images.

### Why Air in Production Images?

Production Dockerfiles include Air for the following use cases:

1. **Runtime Debugging & Troubleshooting**: Enable hot reloading during production debugging sessions
2. **Emergency Hotfixes**: Apply code changes without full deployment cycles
3. **Environment Flexibility**: Use the same image for both development and production
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Debugging**: Test hot reloading behavior in staging environments
5. **Development-to-Production Parity**: Ensure consistent tooling across environments

### Production Air Configuration

Air is pre-installed in production images at `/usr/local/bin/air` with configuration at `/.air.toml`.

#### Default Production Air Configuration

```toml
# .air.toml (included in production images)
root = "."
testdata_dir = "testdata"
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  args_bin = []
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor", "testdata"]
  exclude_file = []
  exclude_regex = ["_test.go"]
  exclude_unchanged = false
  follow_symlink = false
  full_bin = ""
  include_dir = []
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  include_file = []
  kill_delay = "0s"
  log = "build-errors.log"
  poll = false
  poll_interval = 0
  rerun = false
  rerun_delay = 500
  send_interrupt = false
  stop_on_root = false

[color]
  app = ""
  build = "yellow"
  main = "magenta"
  runner = "green"
  watcher = "cyan"

[log]
  main_only = false
  time = false

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = false

[screen]
  clear_on_rebuild = false
  keep_scroll = true
```

### Operational Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Runtime Debugging & Troubleshooting

When production issues require rapid code iteration:

```bash
# 1. Access running production container
docker exec -it service-boilerplate-api-gateway /bin/sh

# 2. Switch to Air hot reload mode
air

# 3. Make code changes (volume mounted in dev override)
# Changes will be detected and automatically rebuilt

# 4. Test fixes in real-time
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# 5. Exit Air when debugging complete
# Container will restart with original binary
```

#### Scenario 2: Emergency Hotfixes

For critical production issues requiring immediate fixes:

```bash
# 1. Identify affected service
docker-compose ps

# 2. Enable hot reload for the service
docker-compose exec api-gateway air

# 3. Apply hotfix by editing mounted source code
# Air will automatically rebuild and restart

# 4. Verify fix
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# 5. Schedule proper deployment for permanent fix
```

#### Scenario 3: Staging Environment Validation

Testing hot reload behavior before production deployment:

```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging with production images
APP_ENV=staging docker-compose up -d

# 2. Enable Air for testing
docker-compose exec api-gateway air

# 3. Validate hot reload functionality
# Make test changes and verify behavior

# 4. Proceed with production deployment
```

### Safety Considerations

#### ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Air is for temporary use only** - not intended for long-term production operation
- **Performance impact** - Air consumes additional CPU and memory during operation
- **File watching overhead** - Monitor resource usage when Air is active
- **Security implications** - Ensure proper access controls for debugging sessions

#### Best Practices

1. **Limited Duration**: Use Air only for the duration of debugging/hotfix sessions
2. **Resource Monitoring**: Watch CPU/memory usage with `docker stats`
3. **Access Control**: Restrict `docker exec` access to authorized personnel
4. **Logging**: Enable detailed logging during Air sessions
5. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure database backups before emergency changes

### Enabling Air in Production

#### Method 1: Override CMD in docker-compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod-air.yml
services:
  api-gateway:
    # ... other config
    command: air  # Override default CMD
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=production-with-air
    volumes:
      - ./api-gateway:/app  # Mount source for changes
```

#### Method 2: Runtime Command Override

```bash
# Override CMD at runtime
docker-compose run --rm api-gateway air
```

#### Method 3: Exec into Running Container

```bash
# Access running container and start Air
docker-compose exec api-gateway air
```

### Monitoring Air in Production

#### Resource Usage Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats service-boilerplate-api-gateway

# Check Air process
docker-compose exec api-gateway ps aux | grep air
```

#### Log Monitoring

```bash
# View Air logs
docker-compose logs -f api-gateway

# Air build logs
docker-compose exec api-gateway tail -f build-errors.log
```

### Configuration Tuning for Production

#### Memory Optimization

```toml
# .air.toml for production use
[build]
  delay = 2000  # Longer delay to reduce CPU usage
  poll = true   # Use polling instead of inotify for stability
  poll_interval = 1000

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = true  # Clean up build artifacts
```

#### Performance Settings

```toml
[build]
  exclude_dir = ["tmp", "vendor", "testdata", ".git"]
  exclude_file = ["*_test.go", "*.md"]
  include_ext = ["go"]  # Only watch Go files
```

### Troubleshooting Air in Production

#### Common Issues

**Air Not Starting**
```bash
# Check if Air binary exists
docker-compose exec api-gateway ls -la /usr/local/bin/air

# Verify .air.toml configuration
docker-compose exec api-gateway cat /.air.toml
```

**File Changes Not Detected**
```bash
# Check volume mounting
docker-compose exec api-gateway ls -la /app

# Verify file permissions
docker-compose exec api-gateway ls -la /app/cmd/
```

**Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs
docker-compose exec api-gateway cat build-errors.log

# Manual build test
docker-compose exec api-gateway go build -o /tmp/test ./cmd
```

**High Resource Usage**
```bash
# Monitor and adjust
docker stats

# Tune Air configuration for lower resource usage
# Increase delay, reduce polling frequency
```

### Integration with CI/CD

#### Staging Pipeline with Air Testing

```yaml
# .github/workflows/staging.yml
- name: Test Air hot reload in staging
  run: |
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose exec -T api-gateway air &
    sleep 10
    # Make test change and verify reload
    echo 'package main; import "fmt"; func main() { fmt.Println("test") }' > test.go
    sleep 5
    docker-compose logs api-gateway | grep "test"
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Network Isolation**: Run Air sessions in isolated networks
2. **Access Logging**: Log all `docker exec` sessions
3. **Time Limits**: Set timeouts for debugging sessions
4. **Code Review**: All hotfixes require post-mortem review
5. **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of all Air usage in production
