# Air Hot Reload Documentation

## Overview

This project uses [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for hot reloading during development. Air is a live-reloading command line utility for developing Go applications that automatically rebuilds and restarts your application when file changes are detected.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Rebuilding**: Monitors Go files and rebuilds on changes
- **Live Restart**: Seamlessly replaces the running binary
- **Fast Compilation**: Incremental builds for quick development cycles
- **Docker Integration**: Works within Docker containers for consistent environments
- **Environment Control**: Different configurations for development vs production
- **Named Networks**: Custom Docker networks with service aliases for reliable connectivity
- **Configurable Naming**: Environment-based Docker container and network naming
- **Enhanced Cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup commands with safety features

## Quick Start

### Development Mode (with Hot Reload)

```bash
# Start all services with hot reload
make dev

# Or start individual services
make air-gateway      # API Gateway only
make air-user-service # User Service only
```

### Production Mode (without Hot Reload)

```bash
# Start services with pre-compiled binaries
make up
```

## Architecture

### Development Setup
- Uses `Dockerfile.dev` with Air installed
- Mounts source code as volumes
- Runs Air in watch mode
- Environment: `APP_ENV=development`

### Production Setup
- Uses standard `Dockerfile` for optimized builds
- Pre-compiled binaries
- Environment: `APP_ENV=production`

## Docker Enhancements

### Named Networks
The project uses custom Docker networks with service aliases for reliable inter-service communication:

```yaml
networks:
  service-network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
    labels:
      - "com.service-boilerplate.network=service"
```

### Service Aliases
Each service has multiple DNS aliases for flexible connectivity:

- **API Gateway**: `${API_GATEWAY_NAME}`, `gateway`, `api`
- **User Service**: `${USER_SERVICE_NAME}`, `users`, `user-svc`
- **PostgreSQL**: `${POSTGRES_NAME}`, `db`, `database`

### Configurable Naming
Docker container and network names are controlled via `.env` variables:

```bash
# Container Names
API_GATEWAY_NAME=service-boilerplate-api-gateway
USER_SERVICE_NAME=service-boilerplate-user-service
POSTGRES_NAME=service-boilerplate-postgres

# Network Name
SERVICE_NETWORK_NAME=service-boilerplate-network
```

### Enhanced Cleanup
Comprehensive cleanup commands with safety features:

```bash
# Safe cleanup with confirmation
make clean-all

# Selective cleanup
make clean-docker    # Remove containers and images
make clean-volumes   # Remove volumes with confirmation
make clean-logs      # Clear log files
```

## File Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configuration.md       # Air configuration details

# Configuration Files
api-gateway/.air.toml
services/user-service/.air.toml

# Docker Files
api-gateway/Dockerfile.dev
services/user-service/Dockerfile.dev
docker/docker-compose.yml          # Production configuration
docker/docker-compose.override.yml # Development overrides
```

## How It Works

### Development Workflow with Docker Override

1. **Environment Setup**: `docker-compose.override.yml` provides development configuration
2. **File Monitoring**: Air watches `.go` files for changes in mounted volumes
3. **Build Trigger**: On file change, triggers `go build` inside containers
4. **Binary Replacement**: New binary replaces the running process seamlessly
5. **Zero Downtime**: Process replacement happens without service interruption

### Docker Compose Override Mechanism

```bash
# Development (automatic override loading)
make dev
# Loads: docker-compose.yml + docker-compose.override.yml

# Production (override ignored)
make up
# Loads: docker-compose.yml only
```

The override file enables:
- **Hot reload** with source code mounting
- **Development tools** and debugging
- **Service aliases** for easy connectivity
- **Environment separation** between dev and prod

## Configuration

Air is configured via `.air.toml` files in each service directory:

- `api-gateway/.air.toml` - API Gateway configuration
- `services/user-service/.air.toml` - User Service configuration

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for detailed settings.

## Development Workflow

1. Start development environment: `make dev`
2. Make code changes in your editor
3. Air automatically detects changes and rebuilds
4. Test your changes immediately
5. View logs: `make logs`

## Environment Variables

- `APP_ENV=development` - Enables Air hot reload
- `APP_ENV=production` - Uses pre-compiled binaries
- `LOGGING_LEVEL=debug` - Enhanced logging in development

## Performance Tips

- Air excludes test files (`*_test.go`) from watching
- Build artifacts stored in `tmp/` directory
- 1-second delay prevents excessive rebuilds
- Color-coded logs for better visibility

## Troubleshooting

See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.
