# Future Development and Enhancements Plan

## Overview

This document outlines planned future developments and enhancements for the service boilerplate project.

## Authentication Service Implementation

**✅ COMPLETED - Phase 2: Auth Service Integration with User Service**

The authentication service has been successfully implemented and integrated with the user service:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

- [x] Design auth service architecture and API endpoints
- [x] Create auth-service directory structure with cmd, internal, migrations
- [x] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [x] Create auth handlers for login, register, refresh token, logout
- [x] Update API gateway to route auth requests to auth-service
- [x] Add authentication middleware to protected endpoints
- [x] Add database models for auth tokens and sessions
- [x] Create database migrations for auth tables
- [x] **Integrate with user-service for user validation (Phase 2)**
- [x] Update configuration files for auth service
- [x] Add unit and integration tests for auth service
- [x] Update documentation with auth service details

### Key Features Implemented
