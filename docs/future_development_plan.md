# Future Development and Enhancements Plan

## Overview

This document outlines planned future developments and enhancements for the service boilerplate project.

## Authentication Service Implementation

Detailed plan for adding authentication service:

### High Priority Tasks

- [ ] Design auth service architecture and API endpoints
- [ ] Create auth-service directory structure with cmd, internal, migrations
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Create auth handlers for login, register, refresh token, logout
- [ ] Update API gateway to route auth requests to auth-service
- [ ] Add authentication middleware to protected endpoints

### Medium Priority Tasks

- [ ] Add database models for auth tokens and sessions
- [ ] Create database migrations for auth tables
- [ ] Integrate with user-service for user validation
- [ ] Update configuration files for auth service

### Low Priority Tasks
